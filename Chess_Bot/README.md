# Chess Bot

Chess bot uses minimax with alpha beta pruning to depth ??, followed by a hueristic function

Heuristics used:
- ??

Potential idea for speed improvement:
- At any point in the search tree with depth > d, if the game is +2 or more, just do that move 
    - maybe d = 5? Depends on speed of alg
